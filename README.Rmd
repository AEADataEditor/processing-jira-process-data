## Requirements

This project requires

- R (last run with R `r paste0(R.Version()$major,".",R.Version()$minor)`)
  - package `here` (>=0.1)
- Python
  - module `venv`
  
Other packages will be installed automatically by the programs, as long as the requirements above are met, see [Session Info](#r-session-info).

### R packages

```{r libs, echo=FALSE}

left_join(as.data.frame(global.libraries) %>% select(Package=global.libraries),
          as.data.frame(installed.packages())) %>%
  select(Package,Version) %>% kable()
```

### Python packages

```{r pylibs,echo=FALSE}

read_csv("requirements.txt",col_names = c("Modules")) %>% kable()
```


### Docker

These requirements are satisfied in the Docker image created by `Dockerfile`, see [README-docker](README-docker.md)

## Data 

### The workflow

![Workflow stages](images/AEADataEditorWorkflow-20191028.png)

### Raw process data

Raw process data is extracted from Jira using the Jira API. An API key is needed. See [README-JIRA.md](README-JIRA.md) for details.

- `issue_history_YYYY-MM-DD.csv` (for detailed transaction-level data)

The data is not made available outside of the organization, as it contains names of replicators associated with each  manuscript and verbatim email correspondence. 

To obtain, run `programs/01_download_issues.py`. This will use the fields as specified in `data/metadata/jira-fields.xlsx`. If fields need to be updated (they are keyed on names), run `programs/00_jira_fields.py` to obtain a new Excel file, and mark the to-be-included fields with "True".

A full download of JIRA issues as of `r YEAR` would be

```
> python3 01_download_issues.py -s 2018-01-01 -e 2023-11-30
Summary:
- Start Date: 2018-01-01
- End Date: 2023-11-30

 About to extract all issue history between these dates from https://aeadataeditors.atlassian.net.
 The output will be written to /home/rstudio/data/confidential/issue_history_2023-12-07.csv.

```

and took 


```
real    35m13.466s
user    0m38.907s
sys     0m5.758s
```

```{r listfiles,include=FALSE}
listfiles <- as.data.frame(list.files(file.path(jiraconf),pattern = "^issue_history_")) 
names(listfiles) <- c("filename")
latest <- listfiles %>% 
  separate(filename,c("base","extension"),sep = "([\\.])",remove = FALSE) %>%
  separate(base,c("prefix","prefix2","date_str"),sep="_") %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date_str, format = "%Y-%m-%d")) %>% select(-prefix)

```

At this time, the latest extract was made `r max(latest$date)`. 

### Anonymized data

We subset the raw data to variables of interest, and substitute random numbers for sensitive strings. This is done by running `02_jira_anonymize.R`. The programs saves both the confidential version and the anonymized version. 

```{r anonymize, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, warning=FALSE}
source(file.path(programs,"02_jira_anonymize.R"),echo=TRUE)
```

### Publishing data

Some additional cleaning and matching, and then we write out the file

```{r publish, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, warning=FALSE}
source(file.path(programs,"10_jira_anon_publish.R"),echo=TRUE)
```



## Describing the Data
```{r read,include=FALSE}
jira <- readRDS(file.path(jiraanon,"jira.anon.RDS"))
```

The anonymized data has `r length(names(jira))` columns. 

### Variables

```{r describe, echo=FALSE,cache=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
description <- read_csv("data/metadata/description_anon.csv")

jira.tmp <- as.data.frame(names(jira),stringsAsFactors = FALSE) 
names(jira.tmp) <- c("name")
jira.tmp %>% left_join(description,by=c("name")) %>% 
  kable()
```

### Sample records

```{r sample,echo=FALSE}
kable(head(jira))
```

### Lab members during this period

We list the lab members active at some point during this period. This still requires confidential data as an input.

```{r lab, warning=FALSE}
source(file.path(programs,"03_lab_members.R"),echo=TRUE)
```

There were a total of `r nrow(lab.member)` lab members over the course of the 12 month period.

### R session info

```{r sessionInfo}
sessionInfo()
```
